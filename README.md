# Speedy Review

## Overview

Speedy Review is a powerful tool designed to enhance the code review process by automating the generation of meaningful commit messages. By leveraging GPT capabilities, Speedy Review analyzes git diffs and current commit messages to suggest concise, informative, and well-structured commit messages that adhere to best practices.

## Use Case

In modern software development, clear and informative commit messages are crucial for maintaining a healthy codebase. They help team members understand the context of changes, facilitate easier navigation through project history, and improve collaboration among developers. However, writing effective commit messages can be time-consuming and often gets overlooked.

### How It Works

1. **Git Hook Integration**: Speedy Review integrates seamlessly with your git workflow by utilizing a commit message hook. When a developer attempts to commit changes, the hook triggers an analysis of the staged changes.

2. **GPT-Powered Analysis**: The tool sends the git diff and the current commit message to a microservice that uses GPT to analyze the changes and generate a suggested commit message based on the content and context of the modifications.

3. **Commit Message Generation**: The generated commit message follows the Conventional Commits specification, ensuring that it is structured, informative, and easy to understand. If the current commit message is already adequate, it will be returned without changes.

4. **Improved Collaboration**: By providing developers with high-quality commit messages, Speedy Review enhances communication within teams, making it easier to track changes and understand the rationale behind them.

5. **Changelog Generation**: Speedy Review also simplifies the process of generating changelogs by providing well-structured commit messages that can be easily aggregated into a coherent summary of changes for each release.

## Benefits

- **Time-Saving**: Automates the process of writing commit messages, allowing developers to focus on coding.
- **Consistency**: Ensures that all commit messages adhere to a standard format, improving readability and organization.
- **Enhanced Clarity**: Provides clear and descriptive commit messages that help team members understand changes quickly.
- **Changelog Efficiency**: Facilitates the creation of changelogs, making it easier to communicate updates and changes to stakeholders.
