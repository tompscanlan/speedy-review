# Speedy Review

Speedy Review is a set of tools and practices designed to improve your git commit review workflow. So far we have:

1. a git hook that automatically generates meaningful commit messages based on code changes. It works best in a team model. In tandem with the team server, it aims to save developers time and improve the quality of commit logs, making code reviews start faster and change logs more useful.

2. a standalone script, Victor.py, that analyzes historical commits and enables you to easily amend them.

3. Something to help what you're working on? [Drop us a note](#contact)

- **Interactive Mode**: Refine suggested commit messages through a command-line interface.

## Setup for Use

Setup takes place in a few differrent areas.

### on a server

1. Run the team server locally, host it permanently, or use a hosted option. For more details, refer to the [Team Generative Service](#team-generative-service) section. Contact us if you'd like a hosted option.

### in your code repository

1. add the Git hook to your project. See the [Git Hook Setup](#git-hook-setup) section for detailed instructions.

### on your dev machines

1. Install dependencies:

   - Python
   - Git

2. Set environment variables:

   - `SPEEDYREVIEW_API_KEY`: API string for authentication from dev machine to team generative server.
   - `SPEEDYREVIEW_ENDPOINT_URL`: URL of the Team Generative Service

3. **_Commit as usual._** The initial message will be generated by Speedy Review. You can accept it entirely, partially, or create your own.

## Git Hook Setup

1. Copy `prepare-commit-msg.py` to your repository's `.git/hooks/` directory, naming it `prepare-commit-msg`
2. Make it executable:
   ```
   cp prepare-commit-msg.py .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
   chmod +x .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg
   ```
3. If hosting your own team server, set up and use the microservice, using its URL for `SPEEDYREVIEW_ENDPOINT_URL` and the `SPEEDYREVIEW_API_KEY` as specified in the microservice setup
4. For hosted options, contact us for setup assistance

## Team Generative Service

The generative service complements the Git hook script by analyzing diffs and generating commit messages. It securely manages team API keys for the Anthropic GPT service.

Set the following environment variables:

- `SPEEDYREVIEW_API_KEY`: Your API key for authentication
- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`: claude-3-opus-20240229
- `ANTHROPIC_MAX_TOKENS`: 1000
- `ANTHROPIC_TEMPERATURE`: 0.7
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`: The private Anthropic token
- `API_PRIMARY_KEY`: The key provided to your team members

Host the app on your preferred platform (Vercel recommended).

## Victor.py Script

Use `victor.py` to analyze and update historical commit messages:

    python victor.py <commit_hash>

This script will:

1. Checkout the specified commit
2. Analyze changes and existing commit message
3. Suggest a new commit message and initiate a `git commit --amend`
4. Update the commit message if approved, creating a new branch
