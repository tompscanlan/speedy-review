# Speedy Review

Speedy Review is a powerful tool designed to enhance your git workflow by automatically generating meaningful commit messages based on code changes. It aims to save developers time and improve the quality of commit logs, making code reviews faster and change logs more useful.

## Why Use Speedy Review?

1. **Save Time**: Developers often spend valuable time crafting commit messages. Speedy Review automates this process, allowing you to focus on coding.

2. **Improve Code Review Efficiency**: Clear, descriptive commit messages make it easier for reviewers to understand changes quickly, speeding up the review process.

3. **Enhance Change Logs**: With better commit messages, your project's change logs become more informative and useful for tracking project history.

4. **Consistency**: Ensure a consistent style and quality of commit messages across your team or project.

5. **Learn Better Practices**: By analyzing the suggested commit messages, developers can learn to write more informative commits over time.

## Features

- **Git Hook Integration**: Automatically suggests commit messages during the commit process.
- **Standalone Script (victor.py)**: Analyze and update commit messages for specific commits.
- **Microservice Architecture**: Utilizes a microservice for diff analysis and message generation (optional).
- **Customizable Message Templates**: Define your own commit message templates to ensure consistency with your team's conventions.
- **Multi-language Support**: Generates appropriate commit messages for various programming languages and file types.
- **Historical Analysis**: Analyze past commits to suggest improvements and maintain consistency with previous high-quality messages. Also, decipher what other developers meant by their obsure commit message.
- **Commit Categorization**: Automatically categorizes commits (e.g., feat, fix, docs, style) based on the changes made.
- **Interactive Mode**: Allows developers to interactively refine suggested commit messages through a command-line interface.

## Setup for use

1. Install dependencies:

    * python
    * git

2. Add githook to your project

3. Export variables

The following environment vars need to be exposed:
* SPEEDYREVIEW_API_KEY  This is an api sting you choose when setting up your own server, it allows others to use your service and borrow GPT credits without exposing your api key
* MICROSERVICE_URL      This is the url the micro service runs at.  If you have api key from us (email at github to request), you can use the SaaS, or you can host your own and let your developers harness the tool without exposing GPT API keys.

3. Commit as usual, but the inital message will be generated by speedy review.  You can choose to accept that totally or partially, or make your own.


## Setup for Development Server

Start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`:

    npm run dev

## Production

Build the application for production:

    npm run build

Locally preview production build:

    npm run preview

## Microservice

The microservice is responsible for analyzing the diffs and generating commit messages. It allows you to either use our SaaS to get going immediatly, or for you to host a solution that your whole team can use.

Ensure that the following environment variables are set:

- `MICROSERVICE_URL`: The URL of the microservice.
- `SPEEDYREVIEW_API_KEY`: Your API key for authentication.
- `ANTHROPIC_MODEL`: claude-3-opus-20240229
- `ANTHROPIC_MAX_TOKENS`: 1000
- `ANTHROPIC_TEMPERATURE`: 0.7

### Git Hook

1. Place the `prepare-commit-msg.py` script in your `.git/hooks/` directory.
2. Make it executable:

   chmod +x .git/hooks/prepare-commit-msg.py

Now, Speedy Review will automatically suggest commit messages when you make a commit.

### Victor.py Script

Use `victor.py` to analyze and update commit messages for specific commits:

    python victor.py <commit_hash>

This will:

1. Checkout the specified commit.
2. Analyze the changes.
3. Suggest a new commit message.
4. Update the commit message if confirmed.
